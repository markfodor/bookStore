# BookStore

This is a demo project which was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.0.
Using this app you can search any book by typing the title. You can also save them to your local store, but note that is will only work on the browser you are using when testing the app. **Your data will not be stored on any third-party server.** 

You can check out a running instance here: [BookStore](https://markfodor.github.io/bookStore/) 

##Used technolgies/tools:
* As a design framework: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) -> It should be fully response.
* As a data provider: [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
